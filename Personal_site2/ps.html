        <h2>Students Attendence Tracker</h2>
        <p>The **Students Attendance Tracker** is a web-based application developed to monitor and manage student attendance, with a focus on students who have attendance less than 75%. The system automatically tracks and flags students whose attendance falls below this threshold. For these students, a notification or alert is triggered, informing them about the need to pay a **condonation fee** in order to be allowed to continue their studies or be considered for exams. This feature helps ensure that students maintain adequate attendance while also providing an automated mechanism for handling attendance-related penalties. The system is designed to be user-friendly, enabling teachers and administrators to easily monitor attendance, generate reports, and manage the condonation fee process efficiently.</p>
        <h2>CGEM's</h2>
        <p>The **CGEM's (Career Guidance and Employment Management System)** is an innovative web-based platform designed to assist students in their career development and job placement journey. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of a student's career progression, including career counseling, job opportunities, skill development, and internship placements. The system allows students to access resources like career workshops, interview preparation, and resume building tools. It also serves as a bridge between students and potential employers by offering a platform for recruiters to post job openings, internships, and other professional opportunities. By tracking student attendance in career-related sessions, CGEM's ensures that students remain engaged in their career development process and are well-prepared for the job market. Ultimately, CGEM's aims to simplify and streamline the process of career guidance, ensuring that students receive the necessary support to successfully transition from education to employment.</p>
